# Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# Remember in Exercise 0 when you started IRB? Start IRB this way again and using the above characters and what you know, use Ruby as a calculator.
# Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
# Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
# Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).
