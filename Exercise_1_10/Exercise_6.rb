# Extra Credit

# Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
# Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
# Are you sure there's only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
# Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.‚Äù
